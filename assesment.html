Regular internal assessments are routinely conducted to ensure the ongoing progress of the students. 
Students are given weekly tests every week and two term examinations and one pre-board examinations.&nbsp; 
All students are required&nbsp; to appear in all internal tests. The college can take strict action against the students who do not attend the examinations without 
any justifiable prior requests to the college. In this way, the students are prepared for their final exams.&nbsp;</p>
